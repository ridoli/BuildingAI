# AI Cancer Detector


## Summary

The goal of this project is to apply AI algorithms to detect cancer or other deseases based on patien's analysis, x-rays or images.


## Background

In many cases, detecting cancer or other deseases in aerly stages, increases the survival rate of the patients.

Therefore, it's vital to detect sympthoms or signals that can alert of the disease.

This can be very useful in many situations such as:
   * Increasing survival rate
   * Reducing medical costs, as treatment will be in earlier stages
   * Improve diagnostics
   * Speed up diagnostics as it can be done partially without supervision

## How is it used?

The tool is deployed to a cloud server, such as AWS or Azure environment. In that way, same data can be easily share across many countries and hospitals, improving the efficiency of the tool.

The tool will be consulted by doctors and, based on the inputs (analysis, images and x-rays) it will try to predict if the patient could suffer any of the diseases registered in its database.

## Data sources and AI methods

The tool will consist on a neuronal network that makes the decisions and a big database that collects data from around the world related t

## Challenges

The biggest challenge will be to design a model accurate enoguh to really being able o predicting good results.


## What next?

First of all, we will need to evaluate if the project is feasible or not, talking with experts on the topic (AI and medicine),
Then, next step would be designing a tool that is able to detect just one disease and then extend it to others.
